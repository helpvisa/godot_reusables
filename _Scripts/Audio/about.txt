// audio propagation scripts

PropNodeManager is an in-editor tool used to place and connect 3D nodes around the scene
(it can acquire children Spatial nodes to fill out a starting list of positions).

Custom3DAudio handles attenuation along these created NodePaths.

The AudioManager manages creating, controlling, propagating all sounds in the scene.
It should be instantiated as a singleton.
