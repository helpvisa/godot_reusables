// custom player controller

These scripts work together to create a controllable player.

Built-in keypress values can and should be modified within PlayerController.

PlayerController directly on character, PlayerCamera on camera,
PlayerAnimStateTracker as a child node (on same level as camera).

Works with built-in player PlayerTemplate scene in _Scenes.
