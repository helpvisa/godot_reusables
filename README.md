# Godot Scripts
## Reusable Template Scripts
Some small scripts I've drafted for a variety of projects. Categorized based on function. Includes some sample scenes too.

Most of these scripts were created with a specific project in mind; though they are reusable a lot of the code would need tweaking to fit a more general use case. This repository is maintained mostly for personal reasons, though the scripts are available for use and expansion for anyone who might find a case where they are helpful!
